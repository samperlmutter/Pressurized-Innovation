## Cloning
`git clone https://github.com/samperlmutter/Pressurized-Innovation`

The folder will be placed in whatever directory you run the command in

## Committing
You can check what files have been changed by running `git status`

Run `git add path/to/filename` to stage that file. If you're at the root level of the directory, you can run `git add .` to add everything you've changed

Once everything you want to stage is staged, run `git commit -m "A descriptive commit message"`

Remember that this only commits to your local repo, if you want everyone else to work with your changes, you have to push 

## Pushing
Make sure you've committed everything you want already, then run `git push origin master`

## Pulling
To update your local repo with any changes made to the github repo, run `git pull origin master`

Note that if there are conflicting changes between what you have locally and what's on github, you'll get merge conflicts.
